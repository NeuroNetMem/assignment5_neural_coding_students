# Assignment 5: Neural coding

This assignment introduces the basic analysis techniques to investigate how
information entering the senses is transformed into a representation in the
brain -- a process called "neural coding".

The assignment is written as a Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains some
background information and it should be possible to accomplish all exercises
using the information in the notebook. Start the notebook via:
jupyter notebook assignment5_neural_coding.ipynb

The assignment is based on this recent review paper that provides an overview
for readers from outside the field:  
A. F. Meyer, R. S. Williamson, J. F. Linden, and M. Sahani. Models of Neuronal Stimulus-Response Functions: Elaboration, Estimation, and Evaluation.  
Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, vol. 10, p. 109, 2017. [link to article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2016.00109)
